## What Makes This Different?

While tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and **Claude** assist with AI-powered code suggestions, **Ctrl+Shift+Fix** stands out with a few *unique power-ups*:


 Inline Bug Detection & Fixing
  Instantly detects bugs and displays AI-generated fixes inside a webview sidebar.
  You can apply a fix with one click â€“ no need to copy/paste from another tab.

 Gamified UI
  Comes with a retro pixel-art inspired GUI for error fixes, making debugging more fun.
  It's not just helpful, it's âœ¨ vibey âœ¨.

 Auto-Build Support (Experimental)
  After applying all fixes, Ctrl+Shift+Fix can auto-compile your code from within VS Code.

 No Fluff, Just Fixes
  Fixes are *surgical*. The AI is instructed to only change the error line and nothing else.
  No hallucinated code, no unwanted edits.

 Made for Beginners (by a Beginner)
  Designed with simplicity in mind, especially for early-stage devs who want guided debugging.
  Built entirely by a first-year CS student â€” so itâ€™s relatable and real.

 Fully Open Source
  You can view, edit, and extend everything. Want it to fix CSS too? You can totally make it happen.

## Current Limitations
Due to continuous large number of API calls for auto-completion and suggestion of possible bugs, resource might get exhausted.


*Built as a solo project by a first-year Computer Science undergrad â€” crafted during midnight vibe-coding sessions and a ton of trial & error.*
